# CLAUDE.md — J105 Sailboat Data Logger

## Project Overview

A Raspberry Pi-based sailing data logger that reads from a B&G instrument system via Signal K
Server (which owns the NMEA 2000 / CAN bus), stores time-series sailing data in SQLite, and
provides a web interface for race marking, history, debrief audio, and performance exports.
Data can be exported as CSV, GPX, or JSON for use in Sailmon and other regatta analysis tools.

## Stack & Tooling

| Concern | Tool |
|---|---|
| Dependency management | `uv` |
| Data source (primary) | Signal K WebSocket via `websockets` (`sk_reader.py`) |
| NMEA 2000 / CAN (legacy) | `python-can`, `canboat` — `can_reader.py`, `DATA_SOURCE=can` |
| Storage | SQLite via `aiosqlite` (schema v20) |
| Web interface | `fastapi` + `uvicorn` |
| Audio recording | `sounddevice`, `soundfile` |
| Audio transcription | `faster-whisper`; optional diarisation via `pyannote-audio` |
| System monitoring | `psutil` + InfluxDB via `influxdb-client` |
| Linting + formatting | `ruff` (line length 100; `E501` suppressed only in `web.py`) |
| Type checking | `mypy` (strict) |
| Testing | `pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`, `pytest-cov` |
| Logging | `loguru` |
| External data | `httpx` — Open-Meteo weather, NOAA CO-OPS tides |
| YouTube metadata | `yt-dlp` |

## Development Workflow

### Mac setup (one time)

```bash
brew install portaudio libsndfile
uv sync
cp .env.example .env        # edit DB_PATH, LOG_LEVEL as needed
```

### Daily dev loop

Follow TDD (see `/tdd` skill): write a failing test, implement, pass, lint, commit.

```bash
uv run pytest               # all tests pass
uv run ruff check .         # lint clean
uv run ruff format --check .  # format clean
uv run mypy src/            # types clean
```

### Issue → PR workflow

When starting work on a GitHub issue:

1. **Mark the issue in-progress**: add a comment with the branch name and who/what is working on it:
   ```bash
   gh issue comment <number> --body "In progress on \`<branch-name>\` (Claude Code on <hostname>)"
   ```
2. Branch off `main`: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature main`
3. Develop with TDD until tests + lint + types pass
4. Push and create PR: `git push -u origin feature/my-feature && gh pr create`
5. Merge to `main` and delete the branch

**All changes to `main` must come through merged PRs.** Never push directly to `main`.

### Environment & Configuration

All config is via environment variables or `.env`. The canonical reference
is `.env.example` — read it for the full list of available settings.

## Coding Conventions

- **Python 3.12+** — use modern syntax: `match`, `X | Y` unions, `tomllib`, etc.
- **Type hints everywhere** — all functions must have fully annotated signatures. Run mypy clean.
- **Ruff is the single formatter and linter** — do not introduce black, isort, or flake8. Line length is 100 chars; `E501` is suppressed only in `web.py` for inline HTML.
- **Modules are small and single-purpose** — if a module is growing beyond ~200 lines, split it.
- **Use `loguru` for all logging** — never use `print()` for operational output.
- **Dataclasses or `typing.TypedDict`** for structured data — avoid raw dicts with unknown shapes.
- **Keep hardware-dependent code isolated** — direct CAN bus access lives only in `can_reader.py`; Signal K WebSocket access only in `sk_reader.py`; camera HTTP control only in `cameras.py`. All other modules work with decoded data structures and can be tested without hardware.

---

## Architecture Principles

- **Signal K is the primary data source**: `sk_reader.py` connects to the Signal K WebSocket. Signal K owns the CAN bus. The legacy direct-CAN path (`can_reader.py`) is available via `DATA_SOURCE=can` but not the default.
- **Hardware isolation**: hardware modules are only imported by `main.py`. All other modules receive decoded data structures, not raw frames or SK deltas.
- **Decode early, store clean**: raw instrument data is decoded to named dataclasses as soon as it arrives. Nothing downstream handles raw bytes or SK JSON.
- **SQLite is the single source of truth**: all data is written to SQLite with a UTC timestamp. Export and web functions read from SQLite, never from live data.
- **Timestamps are always UTC**: store and compute in UTC. Convert to local time only at display/export boundaries.
- **External data is async-friendly**: use `httpx` with async for weather/tide fetching during logging runs.

## Dos and Don'ts

**Do:**
- **All changes to `main` must come through merged PRs** — never push directly to `main`
- **Follow TDD** — write a failing test before implementing new functionality (see `/tdd` skill)
- **Commit and push every change** — after editing any file (code, config, scripts), always commit and push to the current branch immediately. This is especially critical for hotfixes on the Pi — uncommitted changes on the device will be lost on the next deploy. Never leave work uncommitted.
- Write tests for all decoding and export logic
- Use `uv add <package>` to add dependencies — never edit `pyproject.toml` manually for deps
- Keep the SQLite schema versioned with simple integer migrations in `storage.py`
- Log every read error and decode failure with `loguru` at `WARNING` or above

**Don't:**
- **Never push directly to `main`** — `main` is sacrosanct. Always work on a feature branch and merge via PR. If on the Pi and a hotfix is needed, create or use an existing branch, commit and push there, then merge through GitHub.
- Don't parse NMEA 2000 PGNs manually from scratch — use `canboat` or a library; only write custom decoders when necessary
- Don't store data in memory across long runs — flush to SQLite frequently to survive crashes/reboots
- Don't hardcode device paths (e.g., `/dev/can0`) — use config or environment variables
- Don't mix business logic into `main.py` — it should only wire things together and start the loop
- Don't commit the `data/` directory or any `.db` files

---

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests live in `tests/` and run on any machine (no Pi hardware required)
- `conftest.py` provides in-memory SQLite fixtures and sample decoded data structures
- Hardware-dependent modules are mocked in tests
- `test_web.py` uses `httpx.AsyncClient` with `ASGITransport` to exercise all API routes
- **Pre-existing mypy errors in `web.py`** (do not fix unless explicitly asked):
  - `Item "None" of "datetime | None" has no attribute "isoformat"`
  - `Item "None" of "AudioRecorder | None" has no attribute "stop"` (x2)
