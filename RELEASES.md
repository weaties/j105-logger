# Release Notes

## Moments Unified, Sharper Debriefs, Safer Backups (2026-04-24)

Bookmarks, comment threads, and notes are now one thing — "Moments" —
with a unified panel on the session page. Debrief audio matches race
audio channel-for-channel. The box no longer freezes for two minutes
the first time you open a completed session. And restoring from a
backup now tells you immediately if photos are missing.

### Moments — one panel, one tag system
- **Bookmarks, notes, and threads collapse into Moments**
  ([#663](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/663),
   [#672](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/672),
   [#673](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/673)) — the old
  Bookmarks / Notes / Discussion cards are replaced by a single Moments
  panel that holds every race observation, anchored to the right place
  on the timeline. Existing data migrates forward automatically
- **Moment UX v2** ([#678](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/678))
  — subject-first edit flow, a counterparty chip for tagging other
  boats in a protest/mark-room note, and an attachment gallery that
  treats photos and videos the same way
- **Tag provenance + starter vocabulary**
  ([#674](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/674)) — every tag
  records who created it, and fresh installs come with a starter set
  of sailing-specific tags instead of a blank list
- **Phone/ESP32-CAM photo ingest**
  ([#661](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/661)) — ESP32-CAM
  devices can push JPEGs straight into the Moments panel of the active
  race session via a simple HTTP endpoint

### Home page — racing view by default
- **Stripped-down Home during a race**
  ([#665](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/665)) — while racing,
  Home is just the live track, instruments, setup summary, and notes.
  Everything non-essential fades away so the helm can find what they
  need at a glance

### Debrief audio
- **Multi-channel parity with race audio**
  ([#649](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/649)) — when debrief
  recording starts, it now honors the same per-channel naming/labels
  the race recorder was using. If the USB device set changed between
  race end and debrief start, the operator sees a warning instead of
  silently dropping tracks

### Performance
- **Polar grading no longer freezes the Pi**
  ([#680](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/680)) — the first
  view of a completed session used to block every API on the box for
  2–3 minutes while it graded ~400 segments. Grading now runs in a
  worker thread with the full polar baseline pre-loaded, and is warmed
  up in the background the moment the race ends, so the debrief page
  is ready by the time the crew opens it
- **Hot-path SQLite indexes**
  ([#671](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/671)) — adds the
  missing `audio_sessions.race_id`, `winds(reference, ts)`, and
  latest-instrument reverse indexes that the race list and live
  instrument panel hit on every refresh
- **Stale summary cache fixed after results import**
  ([#668](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/668)) — importing a
  regatta results file now invalidates the cached session summary so
  finish positions show up immediately instead of on the next restart

### Backups & restore
- **Atomic SQLite snapshots and integrity validator**
  ([#681](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/681)) — `backup.sh`
  uses `sqlite3 .backup` to stage a consistent DB snapshot before
  transferring, replacing the WAL-checkpoint approach that could race
  with active writes. Every snapshot (and every restore) is now
  cross-checked: if `moment_attachments`, `audio_sessions`, or
  `users.avatar_path` rows point at files that aren't actually in the
  snapshot, the backup report says so and `restore.sh` warns before
  wiping the target. Catches the "25 photo rows, 0 photo files" class
  of silent data loss

### Docs
- **Tightened CLAUDE.md** ([#669](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/669))
  — AI agent instructions reduced to 177 lines and docs sprawl tamed

## Smarter Maneuver Analysis, Bookmarks & Tags, Heel/Trim, Faster Pages (2026-04-21)

Better debrief tools: deeper maneuver analysis, bookmarks and tags to
organize moments across your season, heel and trim now recorded and
shown, a faster history page, and a home page that opens right on your
latest race.

### Smarter maneuver analysis ([#640](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/640))
- **Turn vs. recovery timing** — each tack and gybe is now split into
  two phases: how fast the helm got the boat through head-to-wind, and
  how fast speed came back afterward. Slow turn vs. slow recovery are
  different problems and now show up separately in tooltips and the
  maneuver browser
- **Fairer baseline** — entry speed is now measured from the steady part
  of the approach, not dragged down by a helm bleeding speed in the
  last few seconds before ready-about, so distance-lost numbers are
  more trustworthy
- **No more fake good/bad labels** — when every maneuver in a session is
  tightly clustered, they're all labeled "consistent" instead of
  inventing a best-to-worst split out of noise. Rank chips also show a
  percentile so you still see ordering
- **Overlay chart** — new button on the session page and maneuvers
  browser that plots selected tacks/gybes on a shared timeline anchored
  to head-to-wind, so you can see at a glance which one turned fastest
  or recovered cleanest
- **Historical sessions update automatically** — every past session gets
  re-analyzed in the background on the next start, so the new numbers
  appear everywhere without any manual rebuild

### Bookmarks, anchored comments & tags ([#588](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/588))
- **Bookmarks** ([#589](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/589))
  — mark any moment in a session for later reference
- **Anchored comment threads** ([#592](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/592))
  — pin discussions to a specific maneuver, bookmark, or moment; the
  thread highlights as you scrub past it during replay
- **Tags across everything** ([#595](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/595))
  — one tag system for sessions, maneuvers, threads, and bookmarks,
  with filter chips on lists and an admin page for renaming and merging

### Heel & trim
- **Recorded from the boat** ([#624](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/624))
  — helmlog now captures heel and trim alongside everything else
- **Shown on the session page** ([#646](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/646))
  — new Attitude card in the gauges panel

### Home page & session navigation
- **Home page opens on your latest race** ([#636](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/636))
  — live view while racing, most recent race otherwise. Start/stop and
  crew controls moved to a dedicated `/control` page so a spectator
  can't accidentally end a race
- **Video overlays during maneuvers** ([#641](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/641))
  — optional compass-rose and mini-track overlays fade in over the
  session video only during tacks/gybes, keeping the long upwind and
  downwind stretches clean
- **Share a link to a specific moment** ([#643](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/643))
  — new Share button copies a URL that opens the session paused at the
  current playback time, just like YouTube's "share at current time"
- **Synthesized sessions now show on history** ([#591](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/591))
  — sessions created from imported results are no longer hidden

### Faster pages
- **Session history, summary, tracks and wind fields load from cache**
  ([#594](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/594)) — repeat views
  of the same race skip the heavy recomputation and come back almost
  instantly. Browser-side revalidation lets the browser reuse its copy
  too
- **Weather and tide lookups are cached** — the logger no longer hits
  Open-Meteo and NOAA for the same forecast twice
- **History is pre-warmed** — when a race ends, its summary is built in
  the background so the first time you open it in history it's already
  ready

### Video upload reliability
- **No more half-rendered clips on YouTube** ([#634](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/634))
  — the uploader now waits until the Insta360 export is fully finished
  and verifies YouTube accepted it before moving the source file off
  the exports disk, fixing a case where partially-rendered videos were
  being uploaded and the originals archived before you could re-export

### Setup for new boats
- **New-owner bootstrap guide** ([#627](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/627))
  — step-by-step guide for setting up helmlog on a new Pi for a new
  boat
- **Fresh installs no longer inherit the original owner's identity**
  ([#629](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/629)) — scripts now
  prompt for required settings instead of silently using defaults from
  the upstream project

### Fixes
- **Importing multi-class regatta results no longer fails**
  ([#606](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/606)) — second
  regattas sharing a class (e.g. J/105) with an already-imported one
  now import cleanly

## Maneuver Video Compare + Cross-Session Browser (2026-04-16)

Side-by-side synced video comparison for detected maneuvers, followed by a
full cross-session browser that lets you pool tacks, gybes, roundings, and
synthesized starts across many sessions and filter by regatta, session type,
wind range, and mark side — then compare the selected clips together.

### Maneuver video compare page
- **Synced multi-video playback** ([#566](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/566))
  — open a compare grid from the session page, pick maneuvers, and play their
  YouTube clips side-by-side with a shared play/pause, speed, and pre-roll
- **Per-video and global offset controls** ([#569](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/569))
  — nudge any cell ±0.5s to align, plus a global offset that shifts all cells
  together; restyled Compare button on the session page
- **Per-video SVG track overlay** ([#571](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/571))
  — each cell shows the maneuver's local track rotated into a wind-up frame
  with a ladder reference line, colored by rank
- **Compass-rose instrument gauge overlay** ([#573](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/573))
  — top-left overlay with HDG, BSP, SOG, TWS/AWS readouts and TWD/AWA/COG
  arrows that update in sync with the video
- **BSP recovery bar gauge** ([#575](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/575))
  — vertical bar showing live speed as a percentage of entry BSP, colored by
  recovery state, with a dashed min-BSP marker
- **P→S / S→P direction filter pills on maneuvers panel** ([#577](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/577))
  — filter tacks and gybes by turn direction from the session-page maneuvers
  card
- **Mute-all button, muted by default** ([#579](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/579))
  — multiple simultaneous audio tracks are never useful; cells start muted
  with a single toggle
- **Collapsible filter panel** ([#581](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/581))
  — type / direction / rank / post-start pills hide behind a toggle so the
  grid keeps maximum room for video
- **Watch on YouTube link per cell** ([#583](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/583))
  — deep-link each maneuver to its moment on the original full-race video

### Cross-session maneuver browser ([#584](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/584), [#585](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/585))
- **Top-level `/maneuvers` page** — pools tacks, gybes, roundings, and starts
  across many sessions so a debrief can pull a statistically meaningful set
  of samples at similar wind speeds from across a season, not just one race
- **Generalized compare URL** — `/compare?ids=<session_id>:<maneuver_id>,...`
  accepts pairs from different sessions; the legacy
  `/session/{id}/compare?ids=1,2,3` URL keeps working for back-compat
- **Filter pills** — session type (race / practice), type (tack, gybe,
  rounding, weather, leeward, start), direction, race phase (post-start
  only), and wind-range pills that multi-select to union non-adjacent bands
  (e.g. 6–8 + 12–15)
- **Weather vs. leeward roundings** — each rounding is classified by exit
  TWA (downwind exit = weather mark, upwind exit = leeward) and displayed
  inline as "rounding (W)" / "rounding (L)", with dedicated pill filters
- **Synthesized start "maneuvers"** — each session with a recorded Vakaros
  race_start event gets a synthetic start entry at the gun time, pickable
  and comparable like any other maneuver
- **Start-cell overlay** — compare cells of type `start` show a live
  countdown (T-0:30 pre-gun → GUN at zero → T+0:15 post-gun) and a
  perpendicular distance-to-line readout, computed per-tick from the
  session's start line and track data
- **Zero-maneuver and imported-results sessions hidden** — the picker only
  shows live-sailed sessions that actually have maneuvers, skipping the
  ghost races that multi-class result imports create

### Fixes
- **409 instead of 500 on duplicate regatta adds** ([#563](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/563))
  — the admin Results page now surfaces a clean conflict rather than an
  internal server error when re-adding a regatta

## Sprint 8 — Race Replay, Multi-Channel Audio, Results Import & Session Page Overhaul (2026-04-15)

Full race-replay UI with polar-graded track and event stepping, multi-channel
audio recording with per-position mic isolation and parallel sibling-card
capture, Clubspot/STYC race-results import with session linking, polar
analysis overhauls, debrief audio on the session page, a rebuilt history row
summary, and a session page with wind overlay, resizable track map, and
collapsible gauge layers.

### Race replay ([#464](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/464), [#516](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/516), [#521](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/521))
- **Playback core** ([#465](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/465),
  [#468](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/468)) — play/pause/speed
  scrubber with pause-on-seek, gauge cards with sparklines, and a unified
  clock that fans seeks out from YouTube and multi-channel audio scrubbers
  back to the map cursor and replay controls
- **Polar-graded track** ([#469](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/469),
  [#470](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/470)) — per-segment grading
  pipeline drives the polyline color by polar %; SK track averaged per second
  with source address captured per fix, decimated to match Vakaros vertex
  density, and smoothed for display
- **Boat cursor** — rotating boat icon interpolated between GPS fixes with
  smoothed rotation, a follow-boat toggle, and crisper HDG/COG indicators
- **Maneuver markers & event stepping** ([#475](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/475),
  [#466](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/466)) — clickable markers
  on track, keyboard-driven event navigation, and reclassification of
  large-turn tacks/gybes as roundings
- **Laylines & course overlay** ([#473](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/473))
  — layline kind split by mark, anchored to roundings, wind-frame math fixed,
  type-aware scaling with leeward cap, start-line laylines with 120s grace
  window, and Vakaros race-gun honored as effective start
- **Derived current overlay** ([#523](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/523),
  [#538](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/538)) — phase 1: derive and
  render current vectors on the replay map
- **Cross-surface playback** — media players made independent, audio target
  re-applied on play/loadedmetadata, YouTube clamped to clock state so
  pause-on-seek sticks, throttled YT seekTo

### Multi-channel audio & sibling capture ([#462](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/462), [#509](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/509))
- **Schema & consent** ([#493](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/493))
  — v63 channel_map + transcript_segments + voice biometric consent audit
- **Hardware discovery & capture** ([#494](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/494))
  — pyudev USB device detection and multi-channel recording in `audio.py`
- **Per-channel transcription** ([#495](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/495))
  — per-channel ASR with unified time-sorted segment merge
- **Channel mapping UI** ([#496](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/496),
  [#497](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/497)) — admin channel-map
  page, voice consent acknowledgement flow, and per-session overrides from
  the home page
- **Mixed playback + isolation** ([#498](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/498))
  — Web Audio mixed playback with segment-click channel isolation
- **Export & deletion** ([#499](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/499))
  — multi-channel WAV export preserves all channels; atomic per-channel
  deletion satisfies data-licensing right-to-erasure
- **Sibling-card parallel capture** ([#509](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/509))
  — `AudioRecorderGroup` opens one mono USB receiver per sibling with a
  shared `capture_group_id`; transcription fans out across siblings and
  merges into one time-sorted transcript; session page plays every sibling
  via multi-source Web Audio
- **Per-receiver native players** ([#525](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/525),
  [#540](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/540)) — stacked native
  `<audio controls>` below the mixed player, one per receiver, with per-row
  download; starting one pauses the mix and any other playing sibling
- **Capture hotfixes** — PortAudio re-init on Linux detection, pyudev sound
  subsystem filtered to `card*`, `AudioRecorderGroup` accepted alongside
  `AudioRecorder` on the web layer, and graceful race-start audio failure

### Race results import ([#459](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/459), [#460](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/460))
- **Clubspot provider & importer** — schema v59 with provider protocol, idempotent Clubspot importer, and bundled test fixtures
- **STYC HTML provider** — STYC results import with place dedup and a `series.htm` fallback ([#526](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/526))
- **Admin Race Results page** — browse imported regattas, trigger imports, link imported races to local sessions
- **Auto-discover** ([#524](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/524),
  [#526](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/526)) — Clubspot regatta
  name + classes and STYC series/races discovered from a single URL
- **Session linking** ([#520](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/520))
  — auto-link imported races to local sessions on import, pair by order,
  match by stored date column, `/rematch` endpoint + admin button, session
  page picker to link results manually
- **History & session page polish** — imported races hidden from session
  history listing, session page shows linked fleet results, source links on
  the results page, class ID validation

### Polar analysis ([#534](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/534), [#536](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/536))
- **Full-circle polar diagram** — port/stbd split with panel split by
  point-of-sail and tack; upwind and downwind curves stay disconnected
- **Panel filters** — position, tack, TWS range, delta, and race phase
- **Click-to-highlight** — polar diagram dot click highlights matching replay
  segments via enriched grade mapping carrying bsp + target
- **Baseline race window** ([#536](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/536),
  [#537](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/537)) — exclude pre-start
  from polar baseline

### Maneuvers UI ([#531](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/531))
- **Filter pills** — stackable type/tack/rank/post-start filters on the
  maneuvers card, overlay respects them, and the enriched payload is cached
  per session
- **Tracks & markers** — smoother maneuver tracks with speed-recovery
  markers, tack direction labels corrected, track ticks, and optional
  Vakaros overlay with SK/Vakaros source toggles and row→overlay highlight

### Backup & reporting ([#518](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/518), [#519](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/519))
- **SSH preflight, safety gate, and email reports** — backup script now
  pre-checks the SSH target, refuses to clobber, and mails a summary on
  completion

### CI & test hygiene
- **Nightly review + bisect** ([#514](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/514),
  [#515](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/515)) — replace per-PR
  Claude review with a nightly-on-main job that bisects regressions, plus
  follow-up storage/CI fixes
- **write_audio_session identity regression guard** ([#517](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/517))

### Bug fixes
- **Start-line bias sign** ([#529](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/529))
  — pin→boat bias sign inversion fixed
- **Imported races break /api/state** ([#532](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/532),
  [#533](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/533)) — naive/missing
  start_utc on imported rows no longer 500s the home endpoint; v68/v69
  migrations backfill existing rows
- **Ghost "open" imported races** ([#541](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/541),
  [#542](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/542)) — importer now writes
  `end_utc = start_utc` at insert time so imported rows never get picked up
  by `get_current_race`; the dead `start_utc LIKE '%T%'` filter removed
- **Backup rsync partial-transfer** ([#544](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/544),
  [#545](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/545)) — treat rsync rc=23/24
  as warning instead of failure in backup reporting
- **Clubspot multi-race linking** ([#551](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/551))
  — fix session linking for multi-race days; admin rematch can force-relink
  existing rows

### Debrief audio on session page ([#546](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/546), [#547](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/547))
- **Surface debrief audio + transcript** — attached debrief audio and its
  transcript now render on the session page alongside the race audio
- **Click-to-seek** — clicking a debrief transcript segment seeks the debrief
  audio player
- **Consolidated layout** — race transcript lives under the race audio player,
  debrief renders as a collapsible subsection below it
- **History cleanup** — attached debriefs hidden from the default history
  list so they don't double-count as sessions

### History row overhaul ([#549](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/549))
- **Race-first filter** — default history filter is Race; debrief filter
  removed (debriefs now live attached to their race)
- **Per-row race summary** — each row shows thumbnail, wind, and top-3 fleet
  result (preferring imported `race_results`, always surfacing the own boat)
- **Simpler rows** — inline actions, exports, audio player, and pills
  stripped from list rows; initial load triggers on page render

### Session page: wind overlay, resizable map, collapsible gauges
- **Wind card with TWD** ([#553](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/553))
  — TWD added to wind card with true/apparent stacked by column
- **Wind overlay on track** ([#555](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/555))
  — TWD/TWS met wind barbs drawn along the track with zoom-adaptive cadence
  and hover tooltips
- **Current overlay polish** ([#557](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/557))
  — zoom-adaptive cadence and lighter strokes for the derived current overlay
- **Resizable track map** ([#559](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/559))
  — S/M/L/XL size presets for the session track map
- **Collapsible layer/gauge rows** ([#560](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/560))
  — layer and gauge rows collapse, a current gauge was added, and gauges
  moved above the map

### Discussion threads
- **Shareable deep links** ([#561](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/561))
  — query-param anchors (`?thread=<id>&comment=<id>`) that survive Slack and
  other unfurls, copy-link buttons on threads and comments, flash-highlight on
  arrival, and auth redirects that preserve the query string so a signed-out
  recipient lands on the login wall and returns to the exact thread after
  signing in; scroll pins the thread header to the top unless a linked reply
  would fall below the fold, in which case the reply is centered

### Dependencies
- **ruff** → `>=0.15.10`, **python-dotenv** → `>=1.2.2`,
  **pytest-cov** → `>=7.1.0`, **influxdb-client** → `>=1.50.0`,
  **pyannote-audio** → `>=4.0.4`, **actions/github-script** → v9

## Sprint 7 — Vakaros Ingest, Maneuver Analysis & Diarized Playback (2026-04-11)

Vakaros VKX watched-folder ingest with rich start-line overlays, a new
maneuver-analysis package, diarized transcript playback with crew identification,
multi-camera Insta360 pipeline, and a host of session-management fixes.

### Vakaros VKX ingest ([#458](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/458), [#482](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/482))
- **VKX parser** — pure-Python decoder for the public Vakaros VKX binary format
  (positions, race-timer events, line pings, wind rows)
- **Storage schema v59** — five new tables, content-hash dedupe, FK cascade to
  matched races, and a `vakaros-ingest` CLI subcommand
- **Watched inbox + admin page** — `/admin/vakaros` lists ingested sessions,
  matches them to overlapping races (≥50% time overlap), and supports re-match
- **Session-page overlays** — track selector, start-line geometry with hover
  reveal, flag/boat icons for line pings with relative-time tooltips, wind-tick
  visualization, polar % and wind-relative line bias at race start, boat speed
  and distance-to-line readouts, and Vakaros race start surfaced in the
  maneuvers panel
- **Cross-surface playback fixes** — pause media on seek, transcript follow
  toggle, true-wind-only nearest-lookup, and per-race line-ping trimming

### Maneuver analysis ([#457](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/457))
- **Maneuver analysis package** — entry/exit metrics, distance loss, ranking,
  and YouTube deep-links for tacks and gybes
- **Track diagrams** — per-maneuver charts with TWS overlay, ghost upwind/
  perpendicular projections, actual boat position at the ghost timestamp, and
  explicit Ladder ideal/Δ labels
- **Overlay polish** — sticky tooltips, wind-up overlay, overlay checkbox
  selection, elapsed-time column, and `TIMEZONE` resolved from DB settings

### Diarized playback & session sync ([#443](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/443), [#446](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/446))
- **Diarized transcript playback** — speaker-attributed transcript with crew
  identification and per-voice learning, retranscribe button for undiarized
  segments, and a new retranscribe endpoint
- **Unified playback clock** — map, video, audio, and transcript share one
  clock; transcript highlight is driven directly from `audio.timeupdate`
- **360 video panning** — YouTube embed configured to allow 360° panning, with
  a Watch-on-YouTube fallback link
- **Remote transcribe robustness** — extended timeout, MPS for pyannote, always
  request diarization when offloading, speaker picker reads from response
  envelope
- **Session page reorder** — video under track, audio above transcript

### Multi-camera Insta360 pipeline ([#445](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/445), [#452](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/452), [#455](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/455))
- **Multi-camera pipeline** — import/upload/backup lifecycle, dual-fisheye
  `.mp4` → `.insv` rename during import-matched, 360° detection fixes, and
  local-timezone titles
- **SD-mount auto-import** — launchd agent runs `import-matched` on Insta360
  SD card mount; `fswatch -E` fix so regex quantifiers actually match
- **Watch-on-YouTube link** follows the current video and playhead; static
  assets cache-busted by git SHA

### Session rename + URL slugs ([#449](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/449))
- **Human-readable URLs** — session rename with stable session id alongside
  the slug, debrief and missing-slug URL resolution, and a v58 backfill

### Backup & restore
- **Backup improvements** ([#461](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/461))
  — first-run handling, `.env` capture, and broader Signal K coverage
- **Restore script** ([#463](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/463)) —
  `restore.sh` pulls a snapshot back onto a target Pi; backup now captures
  Grafana provisioning and Influx token with rotation handling

### Bug fixes
- **Session deletion FKs** ([#434](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/434),
  [#436](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/436)) — delete `camera_sessions`,
  `sensor_readings`, and `extraction_runs` before parent rows to avoid FK errors
- **Session start timestamp** ([#437](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/437))
  — captured just before DB insert
- **SK auth password file** ([#438](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/438))
  — works when the helmlog service runs with a different `HOME`
- **Grafana AWA units** ([#439](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/439)) —
  Apparent Wind split into separate AWS and AWA panels; AWA shows degrees
- **Photo upload limit** ([#441](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/441))
  — raise nginx body-size limit above the 1 MB default
- **Crew selector** ([#435](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/435)) —
  show invited-but-not-accepted users
- **mypy clean** ([#483](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/483)) — clear
  remaining mypy errors across `src/`

## Sprint 6 — Rudder Angle & Signal K Security (2026-04-05)

Rudder angle instrument support and Signal K authentication hardening.

### Rudder angle ([#420](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/420))
- **Signal K ingest** — subscribe to `steering.rudderAngle`, decode radians to
  degrees via new `RudderRecord` dataclass (PGN 127245)
- **Storage** — new `rudder_angles` table (migration v52) with configurable
  storage rate (`RUDDER_STORAGE_HZ`) exposed on admin settings page
- **Instrument panel** — live RDR tile showing rudder angle in degrees

### Signal K auth & security
- **Auth token support** ([#418](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/418)) —
  three-tier waterfall: `SK_TOKEN` env var → `SK_USERNAME`/`SK_PASSWORD` login →
  `~/.signalk-admin-pass.txt` fallback. Token applied to WebSocket URI and HTTP
  headers. Backward compatible when no auth is configured
- **secretKey generation** ([#417](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/417)) —
  `setup.sh` now generates a 32-byte random `secretKey` in Signal K's
  `security.json`, fixing device token issuance and SensESP device approval

## Sprint 5 — Web Architecture, Networking & Bandwidth, Calibration (2026-03-24)

Major web architecture refactor, metered bandwidth management, admin networking
tools, and continued analysis and visualization work.

### Web architecture overhaul
- **Route module split** ([#405](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/405)) — decomposed monolithic `web.py` into 24
  domain-specific route modules for maintainability
- **WebSocket live push** ([#405](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/405)) — real-time instrument data streaming to the
  browser via WebSocket
- **WAL mode + connection split** ([#405](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/405)) — SQLite write-ahead logging with
  separate read/write connections for improved concurrency

### Metered bandwidth management ([#403](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/403))
- **Metered-connection mode** — detects cellular/marina networks and enforces
  bandwidth budgets with configurable daily limits
- **InfluxDB bandwidth attribution** — per-path network tagging so dashboard
  panels show exactly where bandwidth is spent
- **Grafana dashboard** — pre-built panels for bandwidth monitoring and alerting

### Admin networking & remote access
- **Network management page** ([#256](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/256)) — WLAN profile switching, interface status,
  and bandwidth monitoring from the admin UI
- **Tailscale, Cloudflare & DNS** ([#256](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/256)) — Tailscale status, Cloudflare routing,
  and DNS configuration on the network page
- **Cloudflare Tunnel wizard** ([#378](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/378)) — interactive setup for remote access
  without port forwarding
- **Config persistence** — InfluxDB and camera config saved to
  `~/.helmlog/config.env` to survive deploys
- **User deletion** ([#381](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/381)) — Delete button on the admin users page

### Calibration & boat settings
- **Instrument calibration category** ([#337](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/337)) — new `instrument_calibration`
  settings category for compass offset, speed factor, etc.
- **Negative value input** ([#407](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/407)) — ± toggle button for mobile numeric inputs
  (e.g., compass deviation)
- **Session settings fix** ([#385](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/385)) — boat setup values now correctly reflected
  during and after active sessions

### Analysis & visualization
- **Analysis framework Phase 2** ([#285](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/285)) — co-op plugin promotion, A/B
  comparison workflow, and version staleness tracking
- **Analysis catalog UI** ([#412](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/412)) — admin page for plugin management, co-op
  catalog with state badges and moderator actions, session-page staleness
  indicator with re-run button, and A/B comparison side-by-side view
- **Visualization framework Phase 1** ([#286](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/286)) — pluggable chart rendering
  for session data with extensible plugin API
- **Session deletion** ([#409](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/409)) — delete sessions from the UI with an
  active-session safety guard

### Auth & profile
- **Change password** ([#340](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/340)) — `PATCH /api/me/password` endpoint with full
  validation chain (credential check, current password verification, length,
  confirmation match) and audit logging. Profile page conditionally renders
  the form only for password-credential users

### Signal K fixes
- **Self-vessel UUID resolution** ([#388](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/388)) — Signal K deltas no longer rejected
  due to mismatched vessel identity
- **Admin API access** ([#384](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/384)) — use `type=admin` in Signal K security.json for
  proper admin-level access

### Theming & UX
- **CSS variable migration** — remaining hardcoded hex colors replaced with CSS
  custom properties across all templates, JS, and Python
- **In-app issue reporting** ([#369](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/369)) — bug report and feature request links
  directly from the app

### Documentation & developer experience
- **Crew race-day guide** — quick reference for crew operating HelmLog during
  races (start/stop sessions, mark events, troubleshooting)
- **AI contributor guardrails** ([#392](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/392)) — improved onboarding docs and CI checks
  for AI-assisted contributions
- **Semantic layer** ([#390](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/390)) — machine-readable domain knowledge module with
  decision tables, state diagrams, and EARS specs
- **Documentation refresh** ([#172](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/172), [#236](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/pull/236)) — roadmap, README, CONTRIBUTING.md,
  and guides updated to match current codebase

### Infrastructure
- **CI dependency bumps** — actions/checkout v4→v6, actions/github-script v7→v8
- **WAL gitignore** — SQLite WAL files excluded to prevent dirty-version false
  positives on Pi deploys
- **Idempotent migrations** — `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` made safe to re-run

## Sprint 4 — Analysis, Session Matching, Tuning Extraction & Skill Tooling (2026-03-18)

Sprint 4 adds a pluggable analysis framework, co-op session matching,
transcript-based tuning extraction, customizable color schemes, and
expanded developer skill tooling.

### Pluggable analysis framework ([#283](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/283), [#309](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/309), [#321](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/321))

Extensible plugin system for post-session analysis:

- **Plugin protocol** — ABC-based plugin API with importlib discovery, SQLite
  cache with data-hash invalidation (schema v42), and preference inheritance
  (platform → co-op → boat → user)
- **Polar baseline plugin** — wraps existing polar analysis as the first
  built-in plugin
- **Sail VMG comparison** ([#309](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/309)) — pure upwind/downwind VMG functions across 5
  wind bands, cross-session `/api/sails/performance` endpoint, and performance
  table on the sails page

### Co-op session matching ([#281](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/281), [#324](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/324))

Proximity-based pairing of co-op sessions across boats:

- **Automatic scan** — configurable time window (15 min) and geographic radius
  (2 NM) to detect overlapping sessions from co-op peers
- **Match lifecycle** — Unmatched → Candidate → Matched → Named, with quorum
  confirmation and shared name synthesis
- **Federation support** — 5 new peer API endpoints for scan, proposal, confirm,
  reject, and name push — all Ed25519-signed
- **Scalability** — parallel fan-out for 20-boat co-ops, proposal dedup,
  centroid caching (schema v45)

### Boat tuning extraction from transcripts ([#276](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/276), [#325](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/325))

Regex-based extraction of tuning parameters from audio transcripts:

- **RegexExtractor** — parses natural language ("backstay 12", "vang 8.5") from
  transcript segments into structured tuning values
- **Extraction run lifecycle** — Created → Running → ReviewPending/Empty →
  FullyReviewed, with accept/dismiss review workflow
- **Auto-create settings** — accepted items automatically create `boat_settings`
  timeline entries linked to the extraction run
- **Review UI** — collapsible settings history with transcript play buttons,
  newest-first timeline, and superseded-default indicators
- **Privacy** — all extraction data is boat-private, never shared with co-op
- Schema v44 adds `extraction_runs` and `extraction_items` tables; 7 API endpoints

### Customizable color schemes ([#347](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/347), [#358](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/358))

Sunlight-optimized theming system:

- **6 presets** with WCAG contrast validation
- **Admin default + user override** — boat-wide default on admin settings,
  personal override on profile page
- **Full compliance** — ~150+ hardcoded hex colors replaced with CSS custom
  properties across all templates, JS, CSS, and Python

### Threaded comments Phase 2 — notifications ([#284](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/284), [#321](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/321))

- **@mention autocomplete** — dropdown in comment textareas with arrow key
  navigation, multi-word name support
- **4 notification types** — mention, new thread, reply, resolved — with
  pluggable channels (platform + email)
- **Attention dashboard** — `/attention` page with nav badge for unread
  notifications
- Schema v43 for notification storage

### Sail management overhaul ([#306](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/306), [#307](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/307), [#308](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/308), [#318](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/318))

- **Point-of-sail field** — upwind/downwind/both classification per sail
  (schema v39)
- **Default sail selection** — `sail_defaults` table (schema v40) with
  pre-selection on session pages
- **Sail management page** — `/sails` with inventory, accumulated tack/gybe
  counts, per-session history with wind summaries

### Auto-start recording ([#345](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/345), [#346](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/346))

- Schedule a future race start time via the home page UI
- Background task fires `start_race()` at the scheduled time with 1 s polling
- Manual start atomically cancels any pending schedule; missed starts are
  detected and cleared

### Developer experience & infrastructure

- **Risk tiers** ([#320](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/320)) — 4-tier classification (Critical/High/Standard/Low)
  with tier-aware `/pr-checklist` and `/spec` skill for structured specs
- **Skill evaluation framework** ([#349](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/349), [#357](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/357)) — test cases for measuring skill
  quality and detecting regressions
- **/skill-compare** ([#354](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/354), [#367](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/367)) — blind A/B comparison of two skill versions
  with correctness, completeness, conciseness, and actionability scoring
- **Skill trigger optimization** ([#353](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/353), [#364](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/364)) — audited descriptions for all 13
  skills with explicit trigger/anti-trigger guidance and 33-case test suite
- **/architecture skill** ([#352](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/352), [#363](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/363)) — codebase comprehension with module map,
  data flow, and complexity hotspots
- **/diagnose skill** ([#351](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/351), [#360](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/360)) — systematic Pi troubleshooting runbook
- **/domain skill** ([#350](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/350), [#359](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/359)) — Signal K paths, NMEA 2000 PGNs, and sailing
  instrument reference
- **Pi test harness** ([#334](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/334), [#335](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/335), [#336](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/336)) — Mac-orchestrated cross-Pi federation
  testing over Tailscale with UI smoke tests
- **Claude Code Review** ([#330](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/330)) — GitHub Actions workflow for automated PR review
- **CI updates** — actions/checkout v6, astral-sh/setup-uv v7
- **Pi fixes** — sudoers exact-match fix ([#361](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/361)), data dir ownership ([#362](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/362)),
  Grafana provisioning permissions ([#361](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/361))

## Sprint 3 — Auth, Boat Settings, Comments & Developer Tooling (2026-03-14)

Sprint 3 adds multi-method authentication, boat tuning capture, and
collaborative race discussion.

### Authentication overhaul — invitation + password + OAuth ([#268](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/268), [#272](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/272), [#279](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/279), [#280](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/280))

Replace the single-use magic-link flow with a proper auth system:

- **Invitation workflow** — admins send email invitations; users register with
  a password on first visit
- **Password authentication** — bcrypt-hashed credentials with forgot/reset flow
- **OAuth login** — Google, Apple, and GitHub identity providers via Authlib
- **Session middleware** — secure cookie-based sessions replace per-request
  token lookup
- **Developer role** ([#271](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/271)) — orthogonal `is_developer` flag gates access to
  the synthesizer and non-standard branch selection in the deploy UI

### Boat tuning settings ([#274](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/274), [#275](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/275), [#297](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/297), [#298](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/298))

Structured capture and playback of boat tuning parameters:

- **Time-series data model** — `boat_settings` table (schema v35) stores
  parameter values with timestamps, supporting both boat-level defaults and
  race-specific overrides
- **Manual input UI** — phone-friendly accordion card on the home page with
  category groups ordered by change frequency, auto-save on field change
- **Session playback panel** — read-only settings panel on the session detail
  page resolves values by timestamp; overridden defaults shown with
  strikethrough annotation; updates when clicking the track or scrubbing video
- **Synthesizer integration** — synthesized sessions now generate realistic
  J/105 tuning data (rig tensions, sail controls, wind-responsive adjustments)

### Threaded comments Phase 1 ([#304](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/304))

Collaborative race discussion anchored to sessions:

- **Comment threads** — create threads on a session with optional timestamp or
  mark reference (weather_mark_1, leeward_mark_2, etc.)
- **Threaded replies** — nested comments with per-user read/unread tracking and
  unread badges
- **Resolve/unresolve** — mark threads as resolved with a summary; resolved
  threads show as hollow green rings on the track map
- **Track map integration** — right-click the track to start a discussion at
  that timestamp; colored dots show open (purple), unread (blue), and resolved
  (green) threads with tooltip previews
- **Crew redaction** — comment content is redacted in co-op API responses per
  data licensing policy

### Developer experience & infrastructure

- **Promote gate** ([#302](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/302), [#303](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/303)) — `promote.yml` GitHub Actions workflow gates
  `main → stage` promotion on a new RELEASES.md heading; ideation-only commits
  are exempt
- **/release-notes skill** — drafts a RELEASES.md entry from commits since
  the last stage promotion
- **/ideate skill** ([#289](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/289)) — capture half-baked ideas into `docs/ideation-log.md`
  with structured metadata
- **Bootstrap fixes** ([#291](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/291), [#292](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/292), [#294](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/294)) — admin login URL printed correctly,
  `sudo` added to data dir removal in `reset-pi.sh`

## Sprint 2 complete — Performance Analysis & Synthesizer (2026-03-12)

Sprint 2 (March 10–24) is feature-complete. 

### Performance analysis

- **Maneuver detection** ([#232](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/232)) — automatic tack and gybe detection from 1 Hz
  heading data, surfaced on the session detail page
- **Polar performance visualization** ([#233](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/233)) — polar diagram overlay on the
  session detail page showing boat performance against the J/105 target polar

### Synthesizer improvements

- **Spatially varying wind model** ([#248](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/248)) — wind direction and pressure
  gradients across the course area instead of a single uniform wind field
- **Tack on headers with realistic randomization** ([#247](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/247)) — synthesized boats
  now tack when lifted, with heading noise and timing jitter for realistic
  tracks
- **Wind model sharing between co-op members** ([#246](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/246)) — co-op boats in a
  synthesized session share the same wind field and start time so their tracks
  are physically consistent
- **Fix: leg-derived marks for wind field visualization** ([#264](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/264)) — wind field
  overlay now uses the actual mark positions from leg geometry instead of the
  original placed marks

### Deploy & infrastructure

- **Promotion history and branch comparison** ([#258](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/258)) — deploy admin page shows
  a commit-level diff between the current branch and the promotion target
- **Fix: create loki/promtail groups before chown** ([#261](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/261)) — setup.sh no longer
  fails on a fresh Pi when the loki/promtail system groups don't exist yet

---

## Promoted to live and stage from main, 2026-03-10

### Synthesize race sessions with interactive Leaflet map ([#245](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/245), [#252](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/252))

Generate synthetic J/105 sailing sessions for testing and demo purposes:

- **Interactive course builder** — Leaflet map with CYC mark pins; click to
  place the race committee boat, auto-compute windward/leeward marks
- **Simulation engine** — J/105 polar interpolation, wind shifts, VMG-aware
  tack selection, and 1 Hz instrument data generation
- **Land avoidance** — real OSM coastline data for Puget Sound; computed marks
  that fall on land are automatically pulled to navigable water
- **Segment-based land crossing detection** — intermediate point sampling
  catches peninsula/island clips even when both endpoints are in water
- Synthesized session type with amber badge in UI, filterable on history page

### Federation phase 1 — identity, co-op data model, session sharing ([#224](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/224))

Boat-to-boat federation with cryptographic identity:

- **Ed25519 keypair generation** — `helmlog identity init` creates a boat card
  with public key and fingerprint
- **Co-op data model** — create, join, and manage cooperative groups of boats
- **Session sharing** — share/unshare sessions with co-op members, with embargo
  enforcement and audit logging
- **Peer API** — inter-boat HTTP endpoints with request signing and verification
- 32 integration tests covering co-op lifecycle, auth, embargo, and data licensing

### Deployment management and promotion workflow ([#222](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/222), [#223](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/223))

Structured release process with stage/live branches:

- **Admin deploy page** — view current version, trigger updates, and monitor
  deploy status from the web UI
- **Evergreen mode** — opt-in automatic deployment on push to the tracked branch
- **Promotion workflow** — `main` → `stage` → `live` branch promotion with
  safety checks

### Data policy compliance — privacy, auth, and deletion controls ([#194](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/194)–[#211](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/211), [#215](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/215))

Comprehensive data licensing policy enforcement:

- **PII deletion** — audio, photos, transcripts, and diarized content can be
  deleted per data policy requirements
- **Field allowlists** — co-op API endpoints enforce strict field filtering
- **Audit logging** — all data access and sharing events are logged
- **Private session isolation** — unshared sessions are invisible to co-op peers

### Configurable Pi health monitor interval ([#249](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/249), [#250](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/250))

- Default collection interval changed from 60 s to 2 s for smoother dashboards
- Non-blocking CPU measurement via `psutil.cpu_percent(interval=None)`
- `MONITOR_INTERVAL_S` env var and admin settings page for runtime tuning

### Mobile navigation overhaul ([#230](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/230), [#231](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/231))

- **Hamburger menu** replaces tab navigation for better mobile usability

### Infrastructure and developer experience

- **GitHub Actions CI** — tests, lint, and type checking on every PR ([#219](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/219))
- **Docker dev container** — Claude Code development environment ([#229](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/229))
- **Community contribution infrastructure** — CONTRIBUTING.md, issue templates,
  PR template ([#174](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/174), [#218](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/218))
- **Fan speed** added to Pi Health Grafana dashboard with shared crosshairs ([#225](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/225))
- **Hostname in footer** — version info now includes the Pi hostname ([#175](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/175), [#221](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/221))
- **reset-pi.sh** — restore a Pi to pre-setup state for reimaging ([#242](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/242))
- **Git ownership fix** — prevent `.git/` conflicts between helmlog service and
  deploy user ([#239](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/239), [#240](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/240))
- **Bootstrap add-user fix** — run as correct user to avoid read-only DB ([#244](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/244))
- **Documentation** — approachability guides, fleet quickstart, operator updates,
  federation protocol gaps ([#216](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/216), [#217](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/217), [#220](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/220))
- **CLAUDE.md** — added `uv sync` dependency guidance ([#251](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/251))

## 2026-03-08

### Embedded YouTube player with track sync ([#183](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/183), [#185](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/185))

Session replay now includes synchronized video:

- **Embedded YouTube player** on session detail page and history page cards
- **Bidirectional track sync** — click a point on the track map and the video
  jumps to that moment; video playback updates the track marker position
- Deep-link support via `?t=<seconds>` for sharing specific race moments

### Session detail page with track map ([#178](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/178), [#180](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/180))

Dedicated session view at `/session/{id}`:

- **Interactive track map** — GPS track rendered with speed-based color coding
- **Video deep-links** — clickable timestamps jump to the corresponding video
- All session metadata (crew, results, notes, transcripts, sails, exports)
  consolidated into a single page replacing the history accordion cards

### Simplified home page ([#170](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/170), [#171](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/171))

Home page redesigned for race-day focus:

- **Idle state** — start buttons only (race, practice, debrief)
- **Active state** — current race card with live instruments and controls
- Red stop button with two-tap safety guard and countdown timer
- Camera start/stop runs fire-and-forget so race API responds instantly
- Extracted inline HTML/CSS/JS from `web.py` into Jinja2 templates and
  static files (`base.html`, `home.html`, `history.html`, `base.css`,
  `shared.js`, `home.js`, `history.js`)

### Gaia GPS backfill ([#101](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/101), [#176](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/176))

Import historical race data from Gaia GPS exports:

- **Track download** — fetch GPX tracks from Gaia GPS API
- **Race classification** — auto-detect race sessions from track patterns
- **SQLite import** — backfill position, heading, and speed data
- **InfluxDB migration** — push historical data to Grafana dashboards

### Insta360 X4 video pipeline ([#155](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/155), [#161](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/161))

End-to-end automated video workflow:

- **Camera control** — start/stop recording via OSC HTTP API, tied to race
  start/stop events ([#98](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/98), [#147](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/147))
- **Camera admin UI** — add/configure cameras, WiFi credentials, status
  monitoring from the web interface ([#147](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/147))
- **Stitch & upload** — Docker-based stitcher with ffmpeg fallback; discovers
  both `.insv` (360°) and `.mp4` (single-lens) recordings
- **Auto-link** — uploaded videos automatically associated with race sessions
  by time overlap
- WiFi SSID/password fields on camera config for direct camera network access

### Remote transcription offload ([#121](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/121), [#146](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/146))

Offload Whisper transcription from the Pi to a faster machine:

- **HTTP worker** (`scripts/transcribe_worker.py`) runs on a Mac or other
  machine with more CPU
- **Admin settings page** — SQLite-backed settings overrides configurable
  from `/admin/settings` in the web UI
- Transparent fallback to local Pi transcription if remote worker is
  unreachable

### Nginx reverse proxy ([#137](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/137), [#167](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/167))

Single-port access to all services on the Pi:

- **Path-based routing** — `/` (Helm Log), `/grafana/` (Grafana), `/sk/`
  (Signal K admin), `/signalk/` (Signal K API)
- Eliminates the need to remember multiple port numbers
- Signal K admin UI moved to `/sk/` to avoid conflict with `/admin/`

### Configurable event naming rules ([#154](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/154), [#159](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/159))

Day-of-week event names are now admin-configurable:

- Admin UI at `/admin/events` for creating and managing event rules
- Custom event names (set via web UI) take precedence over weekday defaults
- Error message shown when starting a race without a daily event set ([#153](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/153))

### Self-service login ([#148](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/148), [#152](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/152))

Existing users can request a new magic link from the login page without
needing an admin to generate an invite token.

### Configurable Pi host references ([#151](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/151))

Removed hardcoded `corvopi` / `weaties` references from scripts and docs.
All Pi-specific values now come from environment variables or are
auto-detected.

### Infrastructure fixes

- **Loki + Promtail** for centralized log management ([#139](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/139), [#142](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/142)), with
  loopback-only config fix ([#162](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/162))
- **Setup.sh fixes** — bcrypt module, data/ permissions, uv Python
  traversal, tmux, locale ([#140](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/140), [#141](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/141), [#144](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/144))
- **Signal K** — fix CORS origins crash on fresh install ([#143](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/143))
- **Grafana** — bind to 0.0.0.0 for Tailscale access, auto-populate
  InfluxDB vars in `.env`, anonymous access with None role for login page
- **Race Track query optimization** — downsample before union, 65x faster
- **Database schema documentation** at `docs/database-schema.md` ([#156](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/156), [#157](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/157))

### Shared navigation, version footer, timezone support ([#129](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/129), [#130](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/130))

Consistent navigation and timezone-aware timestamps across all pages:

- **Shared nav bar** — Home, History, Boats, Users (admin), Audit (admin), and
  Profile links appear on every page; admin-only links auto-hide for non-admins
- **Version footer** — every page shows the git branch, short SHA, and
  dirty/clean status (includes uncommitted changes and unpushed commits)
- **Configurable timezone** — set `TIMEZONE=America/Los_Angeles` (or any IANA
  name) in `.env` to display all timestamps in local time instead of UTC; affects
  race date grouping, weekday event naming, and all displayed timestamps on home,
  history, audit, and admin pages
- 12 new tests (425 total passing)

### Audit log, tags, triggers, headshots, admin nav ([#93](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/93), [#94](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/94), [#99](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/99), [#100](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/100), [#123](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/123))

Major feature batch adding traceability, organization, and user personalization:

- **Audit logging** — all state-changing web routes log user, IP, and action to
  an `audit_log` table; admin audit page at `/admin/audit` + JSON API at `/api/audit`
- **Tags** — full CRUD API for tagging sessions and notes; `tags`, `session_tags`,
  `note_tags` tables (schema v19)
- **Keyword triggers** — auto-create notes from transcript keywords; new
  `triggers.py` module + `scan-transcript` CLI subcommand for retroactive scanning
- **Profile headshots** — self-service avatar upload on profile page (Pillow
  resize to 256×256 JPEG); SVG initials fallback for users without avatars
- **Admin Users nav link** — `/admin/users` is now discoverable from the main
  nav bar (visible to admins only via `/api/me` role check)
- 25 new tests (413 total passing)

### Speaker diarisation on Pi 5 ([#120](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/120))

Pyannote speaker diarisation now works on the Pi 5 (aarch64):

- Enabled `pyannote-audio` pipeline for speaker labeling (`SPEAKER_00`,
  `SPEAKER_01`, …) on transcriptions when `HF_TOKEN` is configured
- Bypassed `torchcodec` `AudioDecoder` which fails on aarch64 — uses
  `soundfile` fallback instead
- Set `HOME` env var in systemd unit so `faster-whisper` can cache models
  under the `helmlog` service account

### Security hardening ([#117](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/117), [#118](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/118))

Comprehensive security hardening of the Pi deployment, baked into `setup.sh`
so all future SD card builds inherit the same posture:

- Dedicated `helmlog` service account (nologin, UID ≈ 997)
- Scoped `NOPASSWD` sudo replacing the blanket Pi OS default
- SSH hardening (X11Forwarding disabled, permissions tightened)
- InfluxDB bound to loopback only; Grafana loopback + login required
- Automatic security updates via `unattended-upgrades`
- Unused services masked (cups, avahi-daemon, bluetooth)
- Signal K bcrypt admin password auto-generated at setup
- SSH safety guard added after lockout incident — `setup.sh` now validates
  that at least one SSH access method remains before tightening config

### Race event naming fix ([#122](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/122))

Custom event names (saved via the web UI) now take precedence over the
weekday defaults (BallardCup on Monday, CYC on Wednesday). Previously,
a saved custom event was ignored on Monday/Wednesday.

### Security audit documentation

Added security audit report and penetration test statement of work
(`docs/`) documenting the 2026-03-01 security review.

### Audio transcription ([#42](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/42), PR [#63](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/63))

Completed recordings can now be transcribed to text directly from the History
page. Transcription runs on the Pi via
[faster-whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper) — no cloud service
required.

- **📝 Transcript** button on every audio-enabled race card in History
- Jobs run in the background; status polling shows a spinner until complete
- Transcripts are stored in SQLite (`transcripts` table, schema v15)
- Model is configurable via `WHISPER_MODEL` env var (default: `base`)
- Speaker diarisation deferred — pyannote.audio is too heavy for Pi CPU

### System health monitoring ([#39](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/39), PR [#62](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/62))

The logger now watches the Pi's vitals automatically.

- `monitor_loop` background task collects CPU/memory/disk/temperature via
  `psutil` every 60 s and writes a `system_health` measurement to InfluxDB
- Home page polls `/api/system-health` every 30 s; a red warning banner
  appears when disk > 85 % or CPU temp > 75 °C
- `GET /api/system-health` endpoint available for external monitoring

### Audio playback and download ([#21](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/21), PR [#61](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/61))

WAV recordings can now be played or downloaded directly from the web UI
without needing to SSH into the Pi.

- Inline `<audio>` player on every History race card with an associated recording
- `GET /api/audio/{id}/stream` — browser-range-request compatible streaming
- `GET /api/audio/{id}/download` — downloads the WAV with `Content-Disposition: attachment`

### Photo caching ([#44](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/44), PR [#61](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/61))

Photo notes no longer reload on every page refresh, which was noticeably slow
over the boat's Wi-Fi hotspot.

- `serve_note_photo` now returns `ETag` + `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`
- `304 Not Modified` responses on repeat loads (effectively free after first load)
- `loading="lazy"` on all photo `<img>` tags

### Sail tracking ([#57](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/57), PR [#60](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/60))

- Sail inventory management on the Boats page (add / delete sails by type and name)
- Per-race sail selection on History race cards (main, jib, kite)
- Sail choices stored in `race_sails` table (schema v14)

### Guest crew position, WAV player on home page, debrief audio ([#38](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/38), [#49](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/49), [#31](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/31), PR [#59](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/59))

- Crew member positions include a **Guest** option
- The home page shows a live audio player when a recording is in progress
- Debrief sessions can be added with a named crew list

### YouTube video linking with Grafana deep links ([#22](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/22), PR [#51](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/51) / [#58](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/58))

- Link any YouTube video to instrument data via a UTC/offset sync point
- Every CSV export row gets a `video_url` deep-link (`?t=<seconds>`)
- Grafana annotation popups link directly to the matching video timestamp
- History page **Add Video** form with optional sync calibration

### Grafana annotations endpoint ([#52](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/52), PR [#54](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/54))

- `POST /api/grafana/annotations` — creates Grafana annotations from race/practice events
- Enables click-through from Grafana time-series panels to race timestamps

### Git version in web UI footer ([#55](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/55), PR [#56](https://github.com/weaties/helmlog/issues/56))

- Branch name and short commit SHA shown in the footer of every web page
- Makes it easy to confirm which version is running on the Pi

### Grafana InfluxDB datasource and dashboards (#earlier)

- Boatspeed, wind, heading, depth, position — all provisioned at setup time
- `can-interface.service` → `signalk.service` → `helmlog.service` dependency chain

### External data: weather and tides

- Open-Meteo hourly weather (wind, air temp, pressure) fetched once per hour
- NOAA CO-OPS hourly tide predictions fetched once per day
- Both written to SQLite and included as extra columns in CSV exports

### Audio recording

- Automatic WAV recording from USB Audio Class devices (Gordik 2T1R tested)
- One file per session in `data/audio/`, named by UTC start timestamp
- Graceful degradation — no device means instrument logging continues unaffected
